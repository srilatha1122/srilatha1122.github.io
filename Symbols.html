        <p> Introduction of Srilatha Kilaru</p> <br>
        <p> I am Srilatha Kilaru, first year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science. 
            My under graduation was in Computer Science and Engineering back in India in 2017 with a GPA of 3.10. After graduating, I received a job offer through campus placements and served there for 4 years. 
            Later, I realized the importance of understanding certain key elements to be able to survive in the computer science industry and decided to pursue higher education by entering a master’s program at BSU for Fall 2021. 
            Coming to the United States and surviving here feels challenging and adventurous day by day.
            Throughout my life in India, I was able to grasp things around me rather quickly and apply them in the daily tasks which created a passion to dig deep into the web development aspects and stand myself as an efficient programmer. 
            Since the United States educational system is widely known for its dynamic nature, I studied the colleges which meets my requirements. I heard about BSU through a friend who recommended to study here. 
            I approached the academic advisor and was really impressed by the way they made me feel about the student culture and benefits through their program. And that’s how I chose to join BSU for higher education.

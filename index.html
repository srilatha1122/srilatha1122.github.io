            <p>I am Srilatha Kilaru, first year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science.
                My under graduation was in Computer Science and Engineering back in India in 2017 with a GPA of 3.10.
                After graduating, I received a job offer through campus placements and served there for 4 years.
                Later, I realized the importance of understanding certain key elements to be able to survive in the
                computer science industry and decided to pursue higher education by entering a master’s program at BSU
                for Fall 2021.
                <br>Coming to the United States and surviving here feels challenging and adventurous day by day.
                Throughout my life in India, I was able to grasp things around me rather quickly and apply them in the
                daily tasks which created a passion to dig deep into the web development aspects and stand myself as an
                efficient programmer.
                Since the United States educational system is widely known for its dynamic nature, I studied the
                colleges which meets my requirements.
                I heard about BSU through a friend who recommended to study here. I approached the academic advisor and
                was really impressed by the way they made me feel about the student culture and benefits through their
                program.
                And that’s how I chose to join BSU for higher education.
